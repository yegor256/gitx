# Gitx â€” Mass Changes to Git Repos in One-Click

Let's say, you have a many repositories locally and you
need to `git pull` all of them. Instead of going one by one,
you simply:

```bash
gitx pull
```

The script will find all repos in the current directory and
will do `git pull` in each of them.

The software is not yet safe, be careful!
